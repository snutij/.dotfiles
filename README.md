I use this repo as a backup of my local config. I format my macOS every 6 months and I was getting tired of redoing everything every time. Huge thanks to @Phantas0s who is a source of learning and inspiration for me.

You can find his work here :

As for the rest of my github repo you can use whatever you want I don't care.
